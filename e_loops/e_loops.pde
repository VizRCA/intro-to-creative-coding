// FOR LOOP 

// the following is an example of a for loop which loops 10 times. 
// the variable 'i' is used to count the loop
// i starts at 0 (i=0)
// the loop is repeated whilst i is less than 10 (i<10) 
// after each loop i is increased by 1 (i++) 


for (int i=0; i<10; i++) {
  println (i); // outputs the value of 'i' during each loop 
}

// the result is an output of  "0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9"
